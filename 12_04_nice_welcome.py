# Ask the user to input their name. Then print a nice welcome message
# that welcomes them personally to your script.
# If a user enters more than one name, e.g. "firstname lastname",
# then use only their first name to overstep some personal boundaries
# in your welcome message.

# Write a script that takes a string of words and a letter from the user.
# Find the index of first occurrence of the letter in the string. For example:
#
# String input: hello world
# Letter input: o
# Result: 4

word = input("what is your name: ")

# returns first occurrence of Substring
result = word.find(' ')

name = word[:result]
print (name)
print(result)
